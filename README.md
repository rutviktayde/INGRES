# INGRES AI-driven ChatBOT

**Empowering Groundwater Insights through AI-driven Virtual Assistance**

---

## Overview

The INGRES AI-driven ChatBOT is an intelligent virtual assistant designed to revolutionize how users interact with India's groundwater resource data. Built for the [India Ground Water Resource Estimation System (INGRES)](https://ingres.iith.ac.in/home), this ChatBOT enables intuitive, real-time access to groundwater assessment information, making complex datasets accessible and actionable for everyoneâ€”from policymakers to the general public.

## Problem Statement

**Background:**  
The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), in coordination with various agencies, annually assesses India's dynamic groundwater resources using the INGRES GIS-based web application. While the portal provides comprehensive data, retrieving specific results and historical trends remains challenging due to the breadth and depth of the database.

**Proposed Solution:**  
The INGRES ChatBOT addresses this challenge by offering a natural-language interface for querying groundwater data, accessing both current and historical assessments, and visualizing results interactively. Its integration with the INGRES database ensures instant, reliable information delivery, fostering greater engagement and informed decision-making.


## Key Features

- **Intelligent Query Handling:**  
  Ask questions in natural language to retrieve precise groundwater estimation data.

- **Instant Data Access:**  
  Real-time results for current and historical groundwater assessments.

- **Interactive Visualizations:**  
  Dynamic scientific diagrams and maps for deeper understanding.

- **Multilingual Support:**  
  Communicate in English and Indian regional languages.

- **Seamless Database Integration:**  
  Direct access to the INGRES database for fast, accurate information.
