## Section 1: What is INGRES and Groundwater Assessment

### India Ground Water Resource Estimation System (INGRES)

**Developed by:** Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) in association with IIT Hyderabad

**Purpose:** INGRES is a GIS-based web application that provides a standardized platform for groundwater resource assessment across all States and Union Territories of India.

**Official Website:** https://ingres.iith.ac.in/home

### What INGRES Provides

According to CGWB, INGRES provides:

- Annual assessment of groundwater recharge (how much new water enters aquifers annually)
- Annual extractable groundwater resources (how much can be safely used)
- Groundwater extraction data (how much is being used)
- Classification of each block/mandal/taluk into categories
- Dissemination of results through a GIS-based platform

### Groundwater Assessment Methodology

**Official Methodology:** Ground Water Estimation Committee 2015 (GEC-2015)

**Assessment Components:** The assessment measures:

1. **Annual Ground Water Recharge:** Total new water entering groundwater annually
2. **Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource:** Recharge minus natural discharge
3. **Annual Ground Water Extraction:** Water being pumped for irrigation, domestic, and industrial uses
4. **Stage of Ground Water Extraction:** Calculated as:

Stage = (Annual Ground Water Extraction / Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource) × 100%

## Section 2: Groundwater Status Categories (Official CGWB Classification)

All assessment units (blocks, mandals, taluks) are categorized by the Central Ground Water Board based on the Stage of Ground Water Extraction:

## Section 13: Important Legal Framework

### Environmental Protection Act, 1986

CGWA operates under Section 3 and 4 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986

**Key Enforcement Points:**
- Section 15 of EPA, 1986: Used for legal action against groundwater violations
- NOC (No Objection Certificate) system for regulation
- Authorized Officers (District Magistrates/Collectors) enforce guidelines

### National Water Policy, 2012

According to National Water Policy:
- Periodic, scientifically-based assessments of groundwater resources mandatory
- Priority order for water allocation:
  1. Drinking water and sanitation (highest priority)
  2. Domestic needs including animals
  3. Food security and agriculture
  4. Minimum ecosystem needs
  5. Remaining water for industrial/other uses

### Model Bill for Groundwater Regulation

**Status:** Ministry of Jal Shakti has issued a Model Bill to all States/UTs for groundwater regulation

**Purpose:** Enabling States to enact legislation for groundwater management and regulation

---

## Section 14: Data Quality and Caveats

### Assessment Methodology

**Official CGWB Statement:** 

"The assessment involves computation of dynamic ground water resources or Annual Extractable Ground Water Resource, Total Current Annual Ground Water Extraction (utilization) and the percentage of utilization with respect to annual extractable resources (stage of Ground Water Extraction). The assessment units (Talukas/blocks/mandals) are categorized based on Stage of Ground Water Extraction, which are then validated with long-term water level trends."

### Data Collection Points

Data for 2024 assessment collected from:
- National Hydrograph Network Stations (NHNS): Over 25,000 observation wells
- Monitoring frequency: 4 times per year (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, annual)
- Data validation: Cross-checked against long-term water level trends
- Satellite-based observations (in some cases): Heliborne geophysical surveys

### Assessment Challenges Acknowledged

According to CGWB:
- Data availability varies across regions
- Trade-off required between best scientific techniques and country-scale applicability
- Methodology updated periodically based on improved data and technology
- Local variations in hydrogeology require site-specific validation

## Section 15: Farmer FAQs Based on Official Guidelines

### Q: How do I know my area's groundwater status?

**A (From CGWB):** Visit INGRES portal at https://ingres.iith.ac.in/home. Enter your state, district, block, and mandal to see current status: Safe, Semi-Critical, Critical, Over-Exploited, or Saline.

### Q: Can I drill a new borewell in my area?

**A (From CGWA Guidelines):** 

- **Safe areas:** Yes, with basic permissions
- **Semi-Critical areas:** Requires permission from district water authority
- **Critical areas:** Generally no (only for essential drinking water)
- **Over-Exploited areas:** NO - strictly prohibited except drinking water
- **Check with:** Local district water authority or agricultural office

### Q: What is the difference between Safe and Over-Exploited?

**A (From CGWB):** 

- **Safe:** Extraction ≤ 70% of annual replenishable resource. Surplus water available.
- **Over-Exploited:** Extraction > 100% of annual replenishable resource. Water being depleted faster than nature replenishes.

### Q: What subsidies am I eligible for?

**A (From PMKSY Guidelines):**

- **Small/Marginal farmers in Safe/Semi-Critical areas:** Up to 80% subsidy for drip irrigation
- **Other farmers:** 45-70% subsidy depending on system and area
- **Additional support:** 50% subsidy on wells, farm ponds, water storage
- **Check eligibility:** Contact local PMKSY implementing agency with land certificate

### Q: How do I apply for PMKSY subsidy?

**A (From PMKSY Official Guidelines):**

1. Collect: Land certificate, Aadhaar, bank details
2. Contact: Local agricultural department or PMKSY office
3. Submit: Application with required documents
4. Inspection: Site inspection by implementing agency
5. Approval: Sign agreement after approval
6. Payment: Submit farmer's share, subsidy released after completion

### Q: Can I use treated wastewater for artificial recharge?

**A (From CGWB Guidelines):** NO - Treated water may contain heavy metals and toxic elements. It must be reused for surface irrigation only, never for groundwater recharge. Only clean rainwater can be used for artificial recharge.

### Q: What happens if my well becomes dry?

**A (From CGWB Regulations):** This indicates declining groundwater levels. Farmers should:
- Check INGRES for area status
- Contact district water authority
- Apply for water conservation scheme benefits
- Consider crop/livelihood shift
- Participate in groundwater recharge programs

### Q: Is my groundwater safe to drink?

**A (From CGWB Water Quality Monitoring):** Get tested for:
- Bacterial contamination
- Chemical contamination (nitrate, arsenic, fluoride)
- Salinity (TDS)
- Contact: Local health department or CGWB office for testing
